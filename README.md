# Eco-friendly-Ads
An ad system that matches sustainable products with sustainable products loving users.

Eco-freindly ads is a hackathon idea developed as a prototype that can help imporove the advertisement systems to prefer/push sustainable products in a greener method to relevant customers.
So the process can be devided into following tasks:
1. Identifying sustainable products through some eco-labeling ageny because we don't want to encourage green-washing; hence it'e better to use certifieable agencies to classify those products. This will work by selecting a region where the eco-labeling gency works and then filtering out products for that region and that product category.
